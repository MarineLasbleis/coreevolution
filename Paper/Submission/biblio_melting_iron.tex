\title{Melting curve of iron}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

\begin{itemize}
    \item \citet{stixrude2014melting} : melting curve used is from \citet{morard2011melting}, (they say they "re-fit" the value in it). To take into account the depression due to light elements, they consider the "cryoscopic equation" (They cite the Atkins, a big book of chemistry. $x$ is the mole fraction of the main phase, here iron) $T=T_{pure}/(1-\ln x)$ with $x=0.89$ (they use this value because it provides a reasonnable value for the melting T of core at the ICB... But not sure exactly which value they consider reasonnable? They cite two papers from 2002)
    \item \citet{morard2011melting} : we should ask Guillaume for the equation of the melting curve? It's not given in the paper.
\end{itemize}
